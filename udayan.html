    <b> Field</b>
    <p>The interaction between two charges is
    determined by Coulomb’s law. How does
    the interaction itself occur? Consider a point
    charge kept at a point in space. If another
    point charge is placed at some distance from
    the first point charge, it experiences either
    an attractive force or repulsive force. This is
    called <b><i>‘action at a distance’</i></b>. But how does the
    second charge know about existence of the
    first charge which is located at some distance
    away from it? To answer this question, 
   <b>Michael Faraday</b>  introduced the  of field.</p>

      Concentration of the ore/ dressing or benefaction:
<br>
 The process of removal of the unwanted materials (e.g., sand, clays, etc.) from the ore is  known as concentration, dressing or benefaction
  [ Gangue: The ores are associated with non metallic impurities, rocky materials and siliceous matter which are collectively known as gangue]
  Extraction of crude metal 
  (i) Conversion of the ore into oxides of the metal of interest 

  (ii) Reduction of the metal oxides to elemental metals.

The extraction of a metal of interest from its ore consists of the following
<b>metallurgical processes.<br>
(i) concentration of the ore<br>
(ii) extraction of crude metal<br>
(iii) refining of crude metal<br></b>
 The extraction of crude metals from the concentrated ores is carried out in two steps
of the metal oxides to elemental metals. The graphical representation of variation of the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction
namely,<b> (i) conversion of the ore into oxides of the metal of interest and </b>
for the formation of various metal oxides with temperature is called Ellingham diagram Ellingham diagram helps us to select a suitable reducing agent and appropriate
temperature range for reduction.
